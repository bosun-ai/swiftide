# Summary of Improvements to PDF Loader PR

## Documentation Corrections
- Fixed references to `pdf-extract` in the documentation to correctly mention `lopdf`, which is the actual dependency used.

## Test Improvements
- Updated integration tests to use portable paths instead of absolute paths specific to the author's system.
- Added documentation explaining how to run the integration tests with proper test data.

## Dependency Management
- Removed system-specific cargo configuration that was unrelated to the PDF functionality.
- This ensures the repository remains clean and doesn't include environment-specific settings.

## Verification
- All unit tests pass (17/17).
- All documentation tests pass (3/3).
- The PDF ingestion example runs successfully.
- No breaking changes were introduced.

These changes improve the quality and maintainability of the PDF loader implementation while ensuring it follows Swiftide's existing patterns and conventions.
