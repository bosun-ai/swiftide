<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Swiftide is a data indexing, processing and query library, tailored for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). When building applications with large language models (LLM), these LLMs need access to external resources. Data needs to be transformed, enriched, split up, embedded, and persisted. Queries can then be augmented by retrieving the indexed data and generating an answer. It is build in Rust, using parallel, asynchronous streams and is blazingly fast.

With Swiftide, you can build your AI application from idea to production in a few lines of code.

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/bosun-ai/swiftide/blob/master/images/rag-dark.svg" alt="RAG" width="100%" >
</div>

While working with other Python-based tooling, frustrations arose around performance, stability, and ease of use. Thus, Swiftide was born. Indexing performance went from tens of minutes to a few seconds.

Part of the [bosun.ai](https://bosun.ai) project. An upcoming platform for autonomous code improvement.

We <3 feedback: project ideas, suggestions, and complaints are very welcome. Feel free to open an issue or contact us on [[discord](https://discord.gg/3jjXYen9UY).

> [!CAUTION]
> Swiftide is under heavy development and can have breaking changes while we work towards 1.0. Documentation here might fall short of all features, and despite our efforts be slightly outdated. Expect bugs. We recommend to always keep an eye on our [github](https://github.com/bosun-ai/swiftide) and [api documentation](https://docs.rs/swiftide/latest/swiftide/).

## Vision

Our goal is to create a fast, extendable platform for data indexing and querying to further the development of automated LLM applications, with an easy-to-use and easy-to-extend api.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Features

- Fast streaming indexing pipeline with async, parallel processing
- Experimental query pipeline
- Integrations with OpenAI, Groq, Redis, Qdrant, Ollama, FastEmbed, and Treesitter
- A variety of loaders, transformers, semantic chunkers, embedders, and more
- Bring your own transformers by extending straightforward traits or use a closure
- Splitting and merging pipelines
- Jinja-like templating for prompts
- Store into multiple backends
- `tracing` supported for logging and tracing, see /examples and the `tracing` crate for more information.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the rust toolchain installed. [rustup](https://rustup.rs) Is the recommended approach.

To use OpenAI, an API key is required. Note that by default `async_openai` uses the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variables.

Other integrations will need to be installed accordingly.

### Installation

1. Set up a new Rust project
2. Add swiftide

   ```sh
   cargo add swiftide
   ```

3. Enable the features of integrations you would like to use in your `Cargo.toml`
4. Write a pipeline (see our examples and documentation)

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage and concepts

Before building your stream, you need to enable and configure any integrations required. See /examples.

A stream starts with a Loader that emits Nodes. For instance, with the Fileloader each file is a Node.

You can then slice and dice, augment, and filter nodes. Each different kind of step in the pipeline requires different traits. This enables extension.

Nodes have a path, chunk and metadata. Currently metadata is copied over when chunking and _always_ embedded when using the OpenAIEmbed transformer.

- **from_loader** `(impl Loader)` starting point of the stream, creates and emits Nodes
- **filter_cached** `(impl NodeCache)` filters cached nodes
- **then** `(impl Transformer)` transforms the node and puts it on the stream
- **then_in_batch** `(impl BatchTransformer)` transforms multiple nodes and puts them on the stream
- **then_chunk** `(impl ChunkerTransformer)` transforms a single node and emits multiple nodes
- **then_store_with** `(impl Storage)` stores the nodes in a storage backend, this can be chained

Additionally, several generic transformers are implemented. They take implementers of `SimplePrompt` and `EmbedModel` to do their things.

> [!NOTE]
> No integrations are enabled by default as some are code heavy. Either cherry-pick the integrations you need or use the "all" feature flag.

> [!WARNING]
> Due to the performance, chunking before adding metadata gives rate limit errors on OpenAI very fast, especially with faster models like 3.5-turbo. Be aware.
