# Task
Your task is to produce a compact representation of the symbols defined in the code.

You will be given chunks of a file, and your response should that same code chunk but stripped of function bodies, comments, and other non-essential parts. If comments contain important information, you should include summarized versions of them in your response. On the first line of the chunk, you will be given the name of the file.

As a special rule the first line of your response should be the programming language of the code followed by the name of the file.

Another special rule is that should the chunk end halfway through a function definition, you should end your response with the keyword "PARTIAL" to indicate that the function definition is incomplete.
