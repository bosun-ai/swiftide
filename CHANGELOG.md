## [0.6.0](https://github.com/bosun-ai/swiftide/releases/tag/0.6.0) - 2024-07-12

### Features

- [70ea268](https://github.com/bosun-ai/swiftide/commit/70ea268b19e564af83bb834f56d406a05e02e9cd) *(prompts)* Add prompts as first class citizens (#145) by @timonv in [#145](https://github.com/bosun-ai/swiftide/pull/145)

````text
Adds Prompts as first class citizens. This is a breaking change as
  SimplePrompt with just a a `&str` is no longer allowed.

  This introduces `Prompt` and `PromptTemplate`. A template uses jinja
  style templating build on tera. Templates can be converted into prompts,
  and have context added. A prompt is then send to something that prompts,
  i.e. openai or bedrock.

  Additional prompts can be added either compiled or as one-offs.
  Additionally, it's perfectly fine to prompt with just a string as well,
  just provide an `.into()`.

  For future development, some LLMs really benefit from system prompts,
  which this would enable. For the query pipeline we can also take a much
  more structured approach with composed templates and conditionals.

- [699cfe4](https://github.com/bosun-ai/swiftide/commit/699cfe44fb0e3baddba695ad09836caec7cb30a6) *(uncategorized)* Embed modes and named vectors (#123) by @pwalski in [#123](https://github.com/bosun-ai/swiftide/pull/123)

````text
Added named vector support to qdrant. A pipeline can now have its embed
  mode configured, either per field, chunk and metadata combined (default)
  or both. Vectors need to be configured on the qdrant client side.

  See `examples/store_multiple_vectors.rs` for an example.

  Shoutout to @pwalski for the contribution. Closes #62.

- [a2ffc78](https://github.com/bosun-ai/swiftide/commit/a2ffc78f6d25769b9b7894f1f0703d51242023d4) *(ingestion_stream)* Improved stream developer experience (#81) by @timonv in [#81](https://github.com/bosun-ai/swiftide/pull/81)

````text
Improves stream ergonomics by providing convenient helpers and `Into`
  for streams, vectors and iterators that match the internal type.

  This means that in many cases, trait implementers can simply call
  `.into()` instead of manually constructing a stream. In the case it's an
  iterator, they can now use `IngestionStream::iter(<IntoIterator>)`
  instead.
