  [`v0.14.0`](https://togithub.com/benbrandt/text-splitter/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#v0140)

  [Compare
  Source](https://togithub.com/benbrandt/text-splitter/compare/v0.13.3...v0.14.0)

  ##### What's New

  **Performance fixes for large documents.** The worst-case performance
  for certain documents was abysmal, leading to documents [that ran
  forever](https://togithub.com/benbrandt/text-splitter/issues/184). This
  release makes sure that in the worst case, the splitter won't be binary
  searching over the entire document, which it was before. This is
  prohibitively expensive especially for the tokenizer implementations,
  and now this should always have a safe upper bound to the search space.

  For the "happy path", this new approach also led to big speed gains in
  the `CodeSplitter` (50%+ speed increase in some cases), marginal
  regressions in the `MarkdownSplitter`, and not much difference in the
  `TextSplitter`. But overall, the performance should be more consistent
  across documents, since it wasn't uncommon for a document with certain
  formatting to hit the worst-case scenario previously.

  ##### Breaking Changes

  - Chunk output may be slightly different because of the changes to the
  search optimizations. The previous optimization occasionally caused the
  splitter to stop too soon. For most cases, you may see no difference. It
  was most pronounced in the `MarkdownSplitter` at very small sizes, and
  any splitter using `RustTokenizers` because of its offset behavior.

  ##### Rust

  - `ChunkSize` has been removed. This was a holdover from a previous
  internal optimization, which turned out to not be very accurate anyway.
  - This makes implementing a custom `ChunkSizer` much easier, as you now
  only need to generate the size of the chunk as a `usize`. It often
  required in tokenization implementations to do more work to calculate
  the size as well, which is no longer necessary.

  ##### Before

  ```rust
  pub trait ChunkSizer {
      // Required method
      fn chunk_size(&self, chunk: &str, capacity: &ChunkCapacity) -> ChunkSize;
  }
  ```

  ##### After

  ```rust
  pub trait ChunkSizer {
      // Required method
      fn size(&self, chunk: &str) -> usize;
  }
  ```

  ````text
  Improves stream ergonomics by providing convenient helpers and `Into`
  for streams, vectors and iterators that match the internal type.

  This means that in many cases, trait implementers can simply call
  `.into()` instead of manually constructing a stream. In the case it's an
  iterator, they can now use `IngestionStream::iter(<IntoIterator>)`
  instead.

  ````text
  Currency does did not work as expected. When spawning via `Tokio::spawn`

  not be respected. Because it had to be removed, improved tracing for
