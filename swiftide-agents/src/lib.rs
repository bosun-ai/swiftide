//! Swiftide agents are a flexible way to build fast and reliable AI agents.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! * **Tools**: Tools can be defined as functions using the `#[tool]` attribute macro, the `Tool` derive macro, or manually implementing the `Tool` trait.
//! * **Hooks**: At various stages of the agent lifecycle, hooks can be defined to run custom logic. These are defined when building the agent, and each take a closure.
//! * **Context**: Agents operate in an `AgentContext`, which is a shared state between tools and hooks. The context is responsible for managing the completions and interacting with the outside world.
//! * **Tool Execution**: A context takes a tool executor (local by default) to execute its tools on. This enables tools to be run i.e. in containers, remote, etc.
//! * **System prompt defaults**: `SystemPrompt` provides a default, customizable prompt for the agent. If you want to provider your own prompt, the builder takes anything that converts into a `Prompt`, including strings.
//! * **Open Telemetry**: Agents are fully instrumented with open telemetry.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! # use swiftide_agents::Agent;
//! # use swiftide_integrations as integrations;
//! # async fn run() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! let openai = integrations::openai::OpenAI::builder()
//!     .default_prompt_model("gpt-4o-mini")
//!     .build()?;
//!
//! Agent::builder()
//!     .llm(&openai)
//!     .before_completion(move |_,_|
//!         Box::pin(async move {
//!                 println!("Before each tool");
//!                 Ok(())
//!             })
//!     )
//!     .build()?
//!     .query("What is the meaning of life?")
//!     .await?;
//! # return Ok(());
//!
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Agents run in a loop as long as they have new messages to process.
