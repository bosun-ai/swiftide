# Filtering Code Outline
Your task is to filter the given file outline to the code chunk provided. The goal is to provide a context that is still contains the lines needed for understanding the code in the chunk whilst leaving out any irrelevant information.

## Constraints
  * Only use lines from the provided context, do not add any additional information
  * Ensure that the selection you make is the most appropriate for the code chunk
  * Make sure you include any definitions or imports that are used in the code chunk
  * You do not need to repeat the code chunk in your response, it will be appended directly after your response.
  * Do not use lines that are present in the code chunk
